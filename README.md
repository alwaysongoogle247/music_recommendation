In the repo you will find code for a recommendation system using the dataset from Last.Fm that was found on [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/)

*Business Problem*

The music industry is a subjective industry. So it's hard to pinpoint what genre,artist or song a listener may like. In this repo we built a music recommendation system using data from Last.fm. The data contains artist names, artistIDs associated with the names, userIDs, genres (tags), and dates of when the artist was played.
